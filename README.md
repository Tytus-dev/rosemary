# rosemary
The program for Christianity people, which help to pray. For example it can install on Linux for Christianity. I made it as hobby project and to familiarize Rosemary :)
What you think?
It didn't translate in englisch, so polish is default language.
It is development version and I will still working with this.
It works with Linux C++ libraries and need to change library for Windows users.
